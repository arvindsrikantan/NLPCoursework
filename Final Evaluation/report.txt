Approach followed for event tagging :

The equivalence class approach was followed, in which six MaxEnt classifiers were modeled. The equivalence classes were comprised of mutually exclusive events as follows:
Class 1: Defended, Beaten, Left alone
Class 2: Caught, Stumped, Bowled, LBW, Catch dropped, Stumping missed, Runout missed, Free hit
Class 3: Runout, Bowled, Boundary by batsman, Boundary by extra, Runs by batsman, Runs by extra
Class 4: Bouncer, Yorker
Class 5: Great save, Poor fielding
Class 6: Edged, Overthrow

The individual accuracies are displayed in the screenshot. 
All of the steps are as instructed.
