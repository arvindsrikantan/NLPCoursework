'' the UNKNOWN was that in one paper , ramanujan had UNKNOWN the work of a UNKNOWN mathematician whose paper had just arrived by the day 's UNKNOWN . in his UNKNOWN papers , ramanujan drew up theorems to make UNKNOWN UNKNOWN more UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . working off UNKNOWN UNKNOWN 's UNKNOWN UNKNOWN theorem , ramanujan UNKNOWN UNKNOWN that could be made to UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . hardy 's UNKNOWN with ramanujan UNKNOWN after ramanujan refused to come to england . hardy UNKNOWN a colleague UNKNOWN in madras , e. h. neville , to mentor and UNKNOWN ramanujan to england . neville asked ramanujan UNKNOWN he would not go to cambridge . ramanujan apparently had now accepted the UNKNOWN ; as neville put it , `` ramanujan needed no UNKNOWN and that his parents ' opposition had been UNKNOWN '' . apparently , ramanujan 's mother had a UNKNOWN dream in which the family UNKNOWN , the UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN her `` to stand no UNKNOWN between her son and the UNKNOWN of his life 's UNKNOWN '' . ramanujan then set UNKNOWN for england , leaving his wife to stay with his parents in india . == life in UNKNOWN == ramanujan UNKNOWN the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN on 17 march UNKNOWN , and at 10 UNKNOWN in the morning , the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN from madras . he arrived in london on 14 april , with e. h. neville UNKNOWN for him with a car . four days later , neville took him to his house on UNKNOWN road in cambridge . ramanujan immediately began his work with littlewood and hardy . after six weeks , ramanujan moved out of neville 's house and took up residence on UNKNOWN 's court , just a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN from hardy 's room . hardy and ramanujan began to take a look at ramanujan 's notebooks . hardy had already received 120 theorems from ramanujan in the first two letters , but there were many more results and theorems to be found in the notebooks . hardy saw that some were UNKNOWN , others had already been discovered , while the rest were new UNKNOWN . ramanujan left a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN on hardy and littlewood . littlewood commented , `` i can believe that he 's at least a UNKNOWN '' , while hardy said he `` can UNKNOWN him only with [ UNKNOWN ] UNKNOWN or UNKNOWN . '' ramanujan spent nearly five years in cambridge UNKNOWN with hardy and littlewood and published a part of his UNKNOWN there . hardy and ramanujan had highly UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . their collaboration was a UNKNOWN of different UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN and working UNKNOWN . hardy was an UNKNOWN and an UNKNOWN of proof and mathematical UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN ramanujan was a UNKNOWN religious man and UNKNOWN very UNKNOWN on his UNKNOWN . while in england , hardy tried his best to UNKNOWN the UNKNOWN in ramanujan 's education without UNKNOWN his UNKNOWN of inspiration . ramanujan was awarded a bachelor of science degree by research ( this degree was later renamed phd ) in march UNKNOWN for his work on highly UNKNOWN numbers , the first part of which was published as a paper in the UNKNOWN of the london mathematical society . the paper was over 50 pages with different properties of such numbers UNKNOWN . hardy remarked that this was one of the most unusual papers seen in mathematical research at that time and that ramanujan showed UNKNOWN UNKNOWN in UNKNOWN it . on 6 december UNKNOWN , he was elected to the london mathematical society . he became a fellow of the royal society in UNKNOWN , becoming the second indian to do so , following UNKNOWN UNKNOWN in UNKNOWN , and he was one of the youngest UNKNOWN in the history of the royal society . he was elected `` for his UNKNOWN in elliptic UNKNOWN and the theory of numbers . '' on 13 october UNKNOWN , he became the first indian to be elected a fellow of UNKNOWN college , cambridge . === UNKNOWN and deathedit === UNKNOWN by health problems throughout his life , living in a country far away from home , and UNKNOWN involved with his mathematics , ramanujan 's health UNKNOWN in england , perhaps UNKNOWN by UNKNOWN and by the UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN food during the first world war . he was UNKNOWN with UNKNOWN and a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN and was UNKNOWN to a UNKNOWN . ramanujan returned to kumbakonam , madras presidency in UNKNOWN and died soon UNKNOWN at the age of 32 in UNKNOWN his UNKNOWN , s. UNKNOWN UNKNOWN , moved to mumbai , but returned to chennai ( UNKNOWN madras ) in UNKNOWN , where she lived until her death at age 95 in 1994. a 1994 analysis of ramanujan 's medical records and UNKNOWN by dr. UNKNOWN . young concluded that it was much more UNKNOWN he had UNKNOWN UNKNOWN , a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN in madras , where ramanujan had spent time . he had two UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN before he left india . when not UNKNOWN UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN can UNKNOWN UNKNOWN for years and lead to UNKNOWN UNKNOWN , a difficult UNKNOWN to UNKNOWN , but once UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . === personality and spiritual lifeedit === ramanujan has been described as a person with a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN and UNKNOWN UNKNOWN , a UNKNOWN man with UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . he lived a rather UNKNOWN life while at cambridge . ramanujan 's first indian UNKNOWN UNKNOWN him as UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . ramanujan credited his UNKNOWN to his family UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN . he looked to her for inspiration in his work , and claimed to dream of UNKNOWN UNKNOWN that UNKNOWN her male UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN , after which he would receive UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN of complex mathematical UNKNOWN UNKNOWN before his eyes . he often said , `` an UNKNOWN for me has no UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN it UNKNOWN a thought of god . '' hardy UNKNOWN ramanujan as UNKNOWN that all UNKNOWN seemed UNKNOWN UNKNOWN to him . hardy further UNKNOWN that ramanujan 's UNKNOWN had been UNKNOWN by UNKNOWN and UNKNOWN in UNKNOWN to his UNKNOWN , not practice by indian UNKNOWN . at the same time , he remarked on ramanujan 's UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN . == mathematical UNKNOWN == in mathematics , there is a UNKNOWN between having an UNKNOWN and having a proof . ramanujan 's talent suggested a UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN that could then be UNKNOWN in UNKNOWN later . it is said by g. h. hardy that ramanujan 's UNKNOWN are UNKNOWN UNKNOWN and that there is often more to them than initially UNKNOWN the eye . as a UNKNOWN , new UNKNOWN of research were opened up . UNKNOWN of the most UNKNOWN of these UNKNOWN include the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN series for , one of which is given below this result is based on the negative fundamental UNKNOWN d = 4 UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN with class number h ( d ) = 2 ( note that 5 7 13 UNKNOWN = UNKNOWN and that UNKNOWN 99 ; UNKNOWN 99 ) and is related to the fact that UNKNOWN to UNKNOWN numbers , which have class number 1 and UNKNOWN similar UNKNOWN . ramanujan 's series for UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN ( UNKNOWN ) and forms the basis of some of the fastest UNKNOWN currently used to UNKNOWN . UNKNOWN the sum to the first term also gives the UNKNOWN for , which is correct to six UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . see also the more general ramanujan UNKNOWN series . one of his remarkable UNKNOWN was the rapid solution for problems . he was UNKNOWN a room with p. c. UNKNOWN who had a problem , `` UNKNOWN that you are on a UNKNOWN with UNKNOWN marked 1 through n. there is a house in between ( x ) such that the sum of the house numbers to the left of it UNKNOWN the sum of the house numbers to its right . if n is between 50 and UNKNOWN , what are n and x ? '' this is a UNKNOWN problem with UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . ramanujan thought about it and gave the UNKNOWN with a UNKNOWN : he gave a continued UNKNOWN . the unusual part was that it was the solution to the whole class of problems . UNKNOWN was UNKNOWN and asked how he did it . `` it is simple . the UNKNOWN i UNKNOWN the problem , i UNKNOWN that the UNKNOWN was a continued UNKNOWN . which continued UNKNOWN , i asked UNKNOWN . then the UNKNOWN came to my mind '' , ramanujan UNKNOWN . his UNKNOWN also led him to UNKNOWN some previously unknown UNKNOWN , such as for all , where is the UNKNOWN function , and related to a special value of the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN function . UNKNOWN into series of UNKNOWN and UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of , , and gives some UNKNOWN UNKNOWN for the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . in UNKNOWN , hardy and ramanujan studied the partition function p ( n ) UNKNOWN and gave a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN series that UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of the number of UNKNOWN of an UNKNOWN . UNKNOWN UNKNOWN , in UNKNOWN , was able to UNKNOWN their UNKNOWN to find an UNKNOWN UNKNOWN series solution to this problem . ramanujan and hardy 's work in this area gave rise to a powerful new method for UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN , called the UNKNOWN method . he discovered UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN in the last year of his life . for many years these UNKNOWN were a mystery , but they are now known to be the UNKNOWN parts of UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN forms . === the ramanujan UNKNOWN === although there are numerous UNKNOWN that could have UNKNOWN the name ramanujan UNKNOWN , there is one UNKNOWN that was very influential on later work . in particular , the UNKNOWN of this UNKNOWN with UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN UNKNOWN in UNKNOWN UNKNOWN opened up new areas of research . that ramanujan UNKNOWN is an UNKNOWN on the UNKNOWN of the UNKNOWN , which has as UNKNOWN function the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN form ( UNKNOWN ) , a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN form in the theory of UNKNOWN forms . it was finally UNKNOWN in 1973 , as a UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN UNKNOWN 's proof of the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN involved is UNKNOWN . UNKNOWN won a fields medal in 1978 for his work on UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . === ramanujan 's UNKNOWN === while still in madras , ramanujan recorded the UNKNOWN of his results in four notebooks of UNKNOWN UNKNOWN paper . these results were mostly written up without any UNKNOWN . this is UNKNOWN the UNKNOWN of the UNKNOWN that ramanujan was unable to UNKNOWN his results and simply thought up the final result UNKNOWN . mathematician bruce c. berndt , in his review of these notebooks and ramanujan 's work , says that ramanujan most UNKNOWN was able to make the proofs of most of his results , but chose not to . this style of working may have been for several reasons . since paper was very UNKNOWN , ramanujan would do most of his work and perhaps his proofs on UNKNOWN , and then UNKNOWN just the results to paper . using a UNKNOWN was UNKNOWN for mathematics students in the madras presidency at the time . he was also quite UNKNOWN to have been UNKNOWN by the style of g. s. UNKNOWN 's book studied in his youth , which stated results without proofs . finally , it is possible that ramanujan considered his UNKNOWN to be for his personal interest UNKNOWN ; and UNKNOWN recorded only the results . the first notebook has UNKNOWN pages with 16 UNKNOWN organised UNKNOWN and some UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . the second notebook has UNKNOWN pages in 21 UNKNOWN and 100 UNKNOWN pages , with the third notebook UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN pages . the results in his notebooks inspired numerous papers by later mathematicians trying to UNKNOWN what he had found . hardy himself created papers UNKNOWN UNKNOWN from ramanujan 's work as did g. n. UNKNOWN , b. m. UNKNOWN , and bruce berndt . a fourth notebook with UNKNOWN UNKNOWN pages , the UNKNOWN `` lost notebook '' , was UNKNOWN in 1976 by george andrews . notebooks 1 , 2 and 3 were published as a UNKNOWN set in UNKNOWN by the tata institute of fundamental research ( UNKNOWN ) , mumbai , india . this was a UNKNOWN edition of the original UNKNOWN , in his own UNKNOWN . in december 2011 , as part of the UNKNOWN of the UNKNOWN anniversary of ramanujan 's birth , UNKNOWN UNKNOWN the notebooks in a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN 's edition . these were produced from UNKNOWN and UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of the original UNKNOWN by expert UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN UNKNOWN research UNKNOWN , chennai . == hardy ramanujan number UNKNOWN == the number UNKNOWN is known as the hardy ramanujan number after a famous UNKNOWN of the british mathematician g. h. hardy UNKNOWN a visit to the hospital to see ramanujan . in hardy 's words : i UNKNOWN once going to see him when he was UNKNOWN at UNKNOWN . i had UNKNOWN in UNKNOWN UNKNOWN number UNKNOWN and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a UNKNOWN one , and that i UNKNOWN it was not an UNKNOWN UNKNOWN . UNKNOWN ' , he UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN is a very UNKNOWN number ; it is the UNKNOWN number UNKNOWN as the sum of two UNKNOWN in two different UNKNOWN . ' the two different UNKNOWN are UNKNOWN = 13 + UNKNOWN = 93 + UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of this UNKNOWN have created the UNKNOWN of `` UNKNOWN numbers '' . UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN is also a UNKNOWN number . == other mathematicians ' UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN == hardy said : `` he UNKNOWN a power of UNKNOWN , a UNKNOWN for form , and a UNKNOWN for rapid UNKNOWN of his UNKNOWN , that were often really UNKNOWN , and made him , in his own UNKNOWN field , without a UNKNOWN in his day . the UNKNOWN of his knowledge were as UNKNOWN as its UNKNOWN . UNKNOWN was a man who could work out UNKNOWN equations and theorems ... to UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of , whose UNKNOWN of continued UNKNOWN was ... beyond that of any mathematician in the world , who had found for himself the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of the UNKNOWN function and the UNKNOWN terms of many of the most famous problems in the UNKNOWN theory of numbers ; and yet he had never UNKNOWN of a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN function or of UNKNOWN 's theorem , and had UNKNOWN but the UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of what a function of a complex UNKNOWN was ... '' . when asked about the methods UNKNOWN by ramanujan to UNKNOWN at his UNKNOWN , hardy said that they were `` arrived at by a process of UNKNOWN UNKNOWN , UNKNOWN , and UNKNOWN , of which he was UNKNOWN unable to give any UNKNOWN account . '' he also stated that he had `` never met his equal , and can UNKNOWN him only with UNKNOWN or UNKNOWN . '' UNKNOWN k. srinivasa rao , `` as for his place in the world of mathematics , we UNKNOWN bruce c. berndt : UNKNOWN UNKNOWN s has passed on to us hardy 's personal ratings of mathematicians . UNKNOWN that we rate mathematicians on the basis of UNKNOWN talent on a UNKNOWN from 0 to 100 , hardy gave himself a score of 25 , UNKNOWN . littlewood 30 , david UNKNOWN 80 and ramanujan 100 . ' '' professor bruce c. berndt of the university of UNKNOWN , during a lecture at UNKNOWN madras in may 2011 , stated that over the last 40 years , as nearly all of ramanujan 's theorems have been UNKNOWN right , there had been a UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of ramanujan 's work and UNKNOWN . further , he stated ramanujan 's work was now UNKNOWN many areas of modern mathematics and physics . in his book scientific UNKNOWN , the physicist UNKNOWN UNKNOWN UNKNOWN of `` srinivasa ramanujan , discovered by the cambridge mathematician hardy , whose great mathematical UNKNOWN were beginning to be appreciated from UNKNOWN to UNKNOWN his achievements were to be UNKNOWN UNKNOWN much later , well after his UNKNOWN death in UNKNOWN for UNKNOWN , his work on the highly UNKNOWN numbers ( numbers with a large number of UNKNOWN ) started a whole new UNKNOWN of UNKNOWN in the theory of such numbers .
